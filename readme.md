## CHIS

*_What is CHIS?_*

	The California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) is the largest state health survey in the nation. It is a random-dial telephone survey that asks questions on a wide range of health topics. CHIS is conducted on a continuous basis allowing the survey to generate timely one-year estimates. CHIS provides representative data on all 58 counties in California and provides a detailed picture of the health and health care needs of Californiaâ€™s large and diverse population.
